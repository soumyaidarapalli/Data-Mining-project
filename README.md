# Credit card fraud detection
# Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning algorithms and techniques. The dataset used was highly imbalanced, necessitating preprocessing steps to improve model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to identify patterns and anomalies.
Data Preprocessing:
Applied Scaling to standardize features.
Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle class imbalance effectively.
Dimensionality Reduction:
Conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to evaluate variance and reduce dimensionality.
# Clustering Techniques:
Implemented K-means Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models to group data points and analyze patterns.
# Anomaly Detection:
Leveraged Isolation Forest to identify potential fraud cases based on outlier detection.
# Machine Learning Models:
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
# Results:
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curves.
Improved fraud detection rates through resampling and anomaly detection techniques.
This project demonstrates the integration of classification, clustering, and anomaly detection methods to build a robust credit card fraud detection system, effectively addressing class imbalance and improving predictive performance.
